# fabiancannaheim

- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabian C. Annaheim
- 👀 I’m interested in **absolutely everything**!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying **computer science at Zurich University of Applied Sciences**
- 💞️ In addition I'm **currently figuring out** what I want to collaborate on ...

I have 3 to 4 years of programming experience, mainly in web development with PHP & Javascript (Full Stack). Through my previous studies I learned a lot about data structures, algorithms, design patterns, programming in general and much more. I want to get in touch with other code lovers and collect more knowledge and experience by collaborating in open source projects. Assistance and recommendations are strongly desired from literally everyone! I am looking forward to hear from you!
