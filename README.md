# fabiancannaheim

- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabian C. Annaheim
- 👀 I’m interested in **absolutely everything**!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying **computer science at Zurich University of Applied Sciences**
- 💞️ In addition I'm **currently figuring out** what I want to collaborate on ...

I have around 2 to 3 years of programming experience, mainly in web development with PHP & Javascript (Full Stack). Through my previous studies I learned a lot about data structures, algorithms, design patterns, programming in general and much more. I really would like to get in touch with other code lovers and collect more knowledge and coding experience by collaborating in open source projects. Assistance and recommendations are strongly desired from literally everyone! I am looking forward to hear from you!
