- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabian C. Annaheim
- 👀 I’m interested in **absolutely everything**!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying **computer science at Zurich University of Applied Sciences**
- 💞️ In addition I'm **currently figuring out** what I want to collaborate on ...

I have around 2 to 3 years of programming experience, mainly in web development with PHP & Javascript. Through my previous studies I learned a lot about design patterns, data structures, algorithms, programming in general and much more. However, my part-time job which I work alongside my studies is more influenced by a procedural than an object-oriented programming paradigm. At university as well as private I worked on small and medium sized object-oriented projects but I do not have that much routine with it. That's why I would love to get in touch with other code lovers and collect more knowledge and experience in object-oriented programming by collaborating in open source projects.

Assistance and recommendations are hardly desired from literally everyone! 

I am looking forward to hear from you!
